# 🖌️ Brushes — Digital Touch

Brushes are like instruments — each one sings a different texture.  
Even without visuals, you can feel brush differences through their **flow**, **speed**, and **pressure**.

## 🧠 Core Types

| Brush | Use | Description |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Pencil | Sketching | Sharp edges, fast motion |
| Ink | Line work | Precise, steady, sensitive |

## ⚙️ Pressure Curve Logic
Pressure = line weight.  
- Light touch → thin lines  
- Heavy press → bold strokes  

If using stylus:
1. Enable *Pen Pressure* in **Settings → Tablet Input**
2. Adjust curve to your hand style

## 🔊 For Blind / Low-Vision Artists
Use **sound-based feedback** from your tablet:
- low pitch → low opacity  
- high pitch → heavy stroke  
- vibration cues → texture differences  

Plugins like **Krita Assistant Tool + Audio Feedback Scripts** can simulate this.
