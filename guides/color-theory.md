# 🎨 Color Theory — Painting with Logic

Color is emotion turned into math.  
You don’t have to *see* color to *feel* contrast.

## 🧩 Color Relationships

| Type | Formula | Emotion |
|------|----------|---------|
| Complementary | Opposite on wheel | High energy, bold |
| Analogous | Neighbors | Calm, natural |
| Triadic | Triangle | Vibrant balance |
| Monochrome | Same hue, diff tones | Focused and clean |

## ⚙️ Hue Logic
Hue = “type of color” (red, blue, etc.)  
Saturation = intensity  
Value = brightness

Combine them in code:
```python
color = (hue, saturation, value)
